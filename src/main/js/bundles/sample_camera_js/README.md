# About this bundle

This bundle provides a camera control widget that allows the user to interact with the map, for example to zoom into the map.
It is implemented in Javascript.
By default this bundle is not included in the sample app `apps/Demo/app.json` configuration.
If desired, you can add it to the `allowedBundles` bundles section there.
