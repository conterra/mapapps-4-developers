/*
    Checks licenses of node dependencies against a list of allowed licenses.
    Fails with exit code != 0 and an error message if a disallowed license is encountered.
    The script should be executed from the project root directory after dependencies have been installed:

        $ tsx ./src/support/js/check-licenses.ts

    To run checks yourself (e.g. to update the allow list or to get details), install
    license-checker yourself and run it from the project root directory:

        $ npm install -g license-checker
        $ license-checker --summary # outputs list of used licenses
        $ license-checker --json    # outputs details


    NOTE: This script only checks production licenses by default.
    Alter this script if you want to check development dependencies as well (see below).
